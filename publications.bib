	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many elements of life can affect sexual health; thus, healthcare professionals require good knowledge of sexual medicine to encounter patients with these issues. We aimed to study final-year medical and midwifery students' self-reported knowledge of factors associated with sexuality and their knowledge of how to evaluate and treat/counsel patients with sexual problems. In addition, educational interests regarding sexual medicine were assessed.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a web-based questionnaire was distributed to final-year medical (n=233) and midwifery (n=131) students graduating between December 2018 and May 2019 in Finland.
RESULTS: Both student groups self-reported insufficient knowledge of how to consider sexuality in mentally ill patients, how to encounter victims of domestic violence/sexual abuse, and how multiculturalism affects sexuality. In addition, compared to the midwifery students, the medical students were more likely to self-report insufficient knowledge of the basics of sexual pleasure and treating the lack of it (p{\textless}0.001), including how to treat sexual problems due to relationship problems (p{\textless}0.001) or chronic diseases (p=0.015). Although several educational areas of interest arose, both student groups had two mutual most desirable educational interests: 1) reasons for dyspareunia and its treatment, n=117/233 (50.2\%) for medical students, and n=60/131 (45.8\%) for midwifery students; and 2) lack of sexual desire and its treatment, n=100/233 (42.9\%) for medical students, and n=55/131 (42.0\%) for midwifery students.
CONCLUSIONS: In both student groups, the self-reported knowledge of sexual medicine was insufficient. Thus, more education on sexual medicine should be included in the curricula of medical and midwifery education.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Female sexual dysfunction is very common, but its determinants remain under-investigated. Vasculogenic impairments are suggested to be related to female sexual dysfunction, but previous literature regarding the association is scarce. This study aims to study the association between arterial health and female sexual function in women in their 60s.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample for this cross-sectional study comprised 117 women (aged 60-64 years) who participated in the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Arterial health was measured according to the participants' pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, and pulse pressure. Sexual function was measured using the Female Sexual Function Index, which resulted in a total score and six sub-scores. Associations were examined using multivariable regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, relationship happiness, systemic menopausal hormone therapy and/or local estrogen, smoking, alcohol risk use, body mass index, and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with a higher total Female Sexual Function Index score (β = 0.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.41) and with higher desire (β = 0.02, 95\% CI 0.01-0.04), arousal (β = 0.04, 95\% CI 0.01-0.08), lubrication (β = 0.04, 95\% CI 0.002-0.08), satisfaction (β = 0.03, 95\% CI 0.003-0.05), and pain (β = 0.06, 95\% CI 0.02-0.10) sub-scores. Also, higher ankle-brachial index was associated with higher satisfaction sub-score (β = 2.10, 95\% CI 0.44-3.73) and lower pulse pressure was associated with higher orgasm sub-score (β = 0.03, 95\% CI 0.0002-0.06). Other associations between ankle-brachial index and Female Sexual Function Index scores were statistically insignificant, but considering the magnitude the findings may imply clinical significance. Systolic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity were not associated with sexual function.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested a plausible association between higher diastolic blood pressure and female sexual function, but considering clinical significance our findings suggest an association between higher ankle-brachial index and good sexual function in women in their 60s.},

Methodologies for sample collection lack golden standards. We compared Puritan DNA/RNA swab (PS) and Copan FLOQ swab (CS) and provided consistent and reliable microbiome profiles analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected two consecutive vaginal samples utilizing PS with room temperature storing and CS with instant freezing from 26 women. Variable region 4 of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with single PCR by custom-designed dual-indexed primers and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq system. Read quality control, operational taxonomic unit tables, and alpha and beta diversities analysis were performed, and community richness, diversity, and evenness were evaluated and compared between the two samplings and tests. Nineteen sample pairs produced detectable, intact DNA during the extraction protocol and/or further microbial profiles. Alpha bacterial diversity indices were independent on the collection protocol. No significant statistical differences were found in the measured beta diversity metrics between the collection methods. Of the women, 43\% had Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiome profile despite of collection method. Previously reported important vaginal microbiome phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria were present in the sample set although their relative abundances varied among individuals. PS and CS enable constant vaginal microbiota sampling. The PS method with no need for instant freezing is suitable for on-site collections at clinics. Furthermore, it seems to be possible to take two samples instead of one with constant microbiological results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Physicians and midwives meet patients with sexual health issues regularly; however, they may have limited sexual medicine education. The study's aim was to evaluate the self-reported competence of medical and midwifery students to bring up sexual health issues with their patients and to assess the barriers that hinder these discussions. The need for additional education was also evaluated.
STUDY DESIGN: A web-based questionnaire was sent to the last-year medical and midwifery students graduating between December 2018 and May 2019 in Finland. In total, 233 medical students and 131 midwifery students participated in the study. Three fields were evaluated: the self-reported competence in discussing sexual health issues and treating patients with these issues, the barriers to bringing up sexual problems, and the need for education in sexual medicine.
RESULTS: The students self-reported better competence in discussing sexual health issues than in treating patients' sexual problems. For the medical students, the most important barriers hindering bringing up sexual health issues were lack of i) time (89.2 \%), ii) experience with sexual medicine (88.1 \%), and iii) knowledge (82.1 \%). For the midwifery students, the most important barriers were i) lack of experience with sexual medicine (73.3 \%), ii) fear of failing to respond to patients' sexual health issues (64.9 \%), and iii) lack of knowledge (62.5 \%). A higher percentage of the midwifery students (96.2 \%) reported an interest in sexual medicine education compared to the medical students (55.4 \%) (OR 13.89, 95 \% CI 5.32-35.71, P {\textless}.001). Majority (76.5 \%) of the medical students and almost half (45.0 \%) of the midwifery students reported receiving too little sexual medicine education (OR 7.30, 95 \% CI 4.00-13.33, P {\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Both student groups reported several barriers hindering bringing up sexual health issues with their patients and expressed a need for more education, particularly the medical students.},

	doi = {10.1111/aogs.14492},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sexual health is an important aspect of quality of life, yet both healthcare professionals and patients might hesitate to bring up the topic during appointments. Our study investigated obstetrician-gynecologists' (OB/GYNs') self-reported competences in discussing and treating sexual problems, as well as the barriers to bringing up the subject. An additional aim was to evaluate the need for continuing education in sexual medicine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to the members of The Finnish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (n = 1212). The survey was completed by 328 respondents (275 specialists and 53 OB/GYN residents). Their background information (gender, age, education, occupational status, daily number of patients, and daily number of patients with sexual health issues) was assessed. The questionnaire included four fields: (A) self-reported competence in discussing and treating patients with sexual problems (three questions), (B) the barriers to bringing up sexual problems with patients (nine questions), (C) the source of education in sexual medicine (two questions), and (D) the need for education in sexual medicine (two questions).
RESULTS: Most of the OB/GYNs self-reported their competence to be good in discussing sexual problems, but poor in treating patients' sexual problems. The male OB/GYNs reported better competence than did the females. Several barriers were identified-most frequently, "shortness of the appointment time" (76\%), "lack of knowledge about sexual medicine" (75\%), and "lack of experience with sexual medicine" (74\%). Older OB/GYNs and male OB/GYNs reported fewer barriers. The majority of the respondents considered their previous education in sexual medicine to be insufficient, especially in medical school (95\%), but also in residency (83\%), and they reported a need for additional education.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated several barriers that hindered OB/GYNs from assessing sexual problems during appointments. Although OB/GYNs reported a good competence in discussing sexual problems, they reported a poor competence in treating them. Their previous education in sexual medicine was rated as insufficient, and continuing education was desired. The information provided by our study can be used for improving and organizing education in sexual medicine, which is crucial for diminishing the barriers to discussing and treating sexual problems.},

We aimed to assess the barriers that hinder GPs from bringing up sexual health issues and to evaluate the need for education on sexual medicine. Design A web-based questionnaire was used. Setting Four fields were included: A) the self-reported competence in discussing sexual health and treating patients with these issues, B) the barriers to bringing up patients' sexual health problems, C) the source of education on sexual medicine and D) the need for education on sexual medicine. Subjects A random sample of 1000 GPs in Finland (a response rate of 43.5\%, n = 402). Main outcome measures GPs' self-assessed competence in discussing and treating sexual health issues, related barriers to bringing up the topic and the reported need for education. Results The main reasons reported for not bringing up sexual health issues were shortness of the appointment time (85.6\%), a lack of knowledge (83.6\%) and a lack of experience with sexual medicine (81.8\%). The male GPs reported better competence in discussing the issues and treating male patients, whereas the female GPs reported better competence in discussing the issues with female patients. No differences emerged between genders regarding treating female patients. Nearly 90\% of the GPs expressed needing more education about sexual medicine. Conclusions Although the GPs reported good competence in discussing sexual health issues with their patients, several barriers to bringing up sexual health issues emerged.

Combined HSV-1 and HSV-2-IgG antibodies were assessed in the first baseline serum samples with an indirect enzyme immunoassay method. The individuals with seronegative or borderline HSV serology at baseline were additionally tested using their latest FU serum sample available. The overall HSV seroprevalence during the FU was 58.9\% (168/285) among the women and 53.3\% (64/120) among their spouses. The seroconversion rate was 11.4\% (15/132) and 12.5\% (8/64) among women and their spouses, respectively. Both spouses were HSV seropositive in 39.2\% (47/120). To determine the HSV-2 seroprevalence, we also tested all HSV-seropositive participants using HSV-2-specific antigen. HSV-2 seropositivity was detected in 10.9\% (44/405) of the participants. The age (p = 0.006) and history of genital warts (p = 0.006) of the women were associated with combined HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 seropositivity, while a younger age was related to HSV seroconversion (p = 0.023). Among the male spouses, HSV seropositivity was associated with the practice of oral sex (p = 0.033). To conclude, women of childbearing age acquire primary HSV infections and the presence of HSV in oral epithelium is common among HSV-seropositive individuals.},

STUDY DESIGN: A web-based questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 1,000 GPs in Finland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study aim was to determine GPs' self-reported inquiry into sexual problems with patients who have chronic diseases and GPs' awareness of medications inducing sexual problems.
RESULTS: Only 16.2\% of the GPs inquired about sexual health issues, typically during appointments dealing with reproductive organs. A majority (66.9\%) considered sexual problems to be side-effects of medications, but only 17.9\% followed up about them. Compared to male GPs, female GPs were more likely to inquire about gynecologic patients' sexual issues (OR 1.77, 95\% CI 1.05-2.99), but less likely to ask about them with urologic (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.35-0.91) and neurologic patients (OR 0.35, 95\% CI 0.17-0.72). The GPs aged 40-49 and 50-65 were more likely than those aged 27-39 to inquire about sexual health issues among patients with cardiovascular (OR 2.87, 95\% CI 1.11-7.44, OR 2.89, 95\% CI 1.16-7.19) and neurologic (OR 4.63, 95\% CI 1.45-14.82, OR 5.68, 95\% CI 1.87-17.23) diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: GPs seldom inquire about sexual problems with patients who have chronic diseases or after prescribing medications for these conditions, which may lead to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sexual problems.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12879-021-06029-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant microbiota composition has been linked to disease development at numerous anatomical sites. Microbiota changes in reaction to viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), have been investigated almost exclusively in the female reproductive tract. However, HPV infection may also affect male health by reducing semen quality and fertility. The aim of this study was to investigate whether present HPV DNA is associated with detectable changes in semen bacterial microbiota composition and diversity.
METHODS: This study relied on stored semen samples from 31 fertile healthy men who participated in the Finnish family HPV Study during the years 1998-2001. DNA was extracted from semen with PCR template preparation kit. HPV was genotyped using Luminex-based Multimetrix® assay. Microbiota was analyzed from the V3-V4 region of 16S rDNA gene following sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. All statistical analyses were performed with Calypso software version 8.84.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 19.4\% (6/31) of the semen samples. HPV status in the semen did not impact the α-diversity estimations, as measured by Chao1 and Shannon indices, nor ß-diversity. Nevertheless, HPV-positive semen samples exhibited differences in the taxonomic composition of the bacterial microbiota including higher abundances of Moraxellaceae (p = 0.028), Streptococcus (p = 0.0058) and Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.012) compared to HPV-negative semen samples.
CONCLUSION: HPV infection is associated with altered bacterial microbiota composition in semen, and this might have in impact to male health in general. As of present, it is unclear whether these changes result from HPV infection or whether altered bacterial microbiota increases susceptibility to HPV infection. More research is needed on viral-bacterial interactions in the male reproductive system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the head and neck region is poorly understood, and their impact on collective HPV-specific immunity is not known.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis of HPV16-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in 21 women with known oral and genital HPV DNA status and HPV serology (Ab) based on 6-year follow-up data. These women being a subgroup from the Finnish Family HPV Study were recalled for blood sampling to be tested for their CMI-responses to HPV16 E2, E6, and E7 peptides.
RESULTS: The results showed that HPV16 E2-specific lymphocyte proliferation was more prevalent in women who tested HPV16 DNA negative in oral mucosa and were either HPV16 seropositive or negative than in HPV16 DNA+/Ab+ women (p = 0.046 and p = 0.035). In addition, the HPV16 DNA-/Ab- women most often displayed E6-specific proliferation (p = 0.020). Proportional cytokine profiles indicated that oral HPV16-negative women were characterized by prominent IFN-γ and IL-5 secretion not found in women with persisting oral HPV16 (p = 0.014 and p = 0.040, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the naturally arising immune response induced by oral HPV infections displays a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile while women with persisting oral HPV16 might have an impaired HPV16-specific CMI, shifted partly toward a Th2 profile, similarly as seen earlier among patients with high-grade genital HPV lesions. Thus, the lack of HPV 16 E2 and E6 specific T memory cells and Th2 cytokines might also predispose women for persistent oral HPV16 infection which might be related to the risk of cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Domestic violence is a hidden epidemic. We used a two-question screening tool to explore the prevalence of domestic violence among gynaecological outpatients. We also retrospectively assessed whether there was a change in the prevalence rate of self-reported violence after the launch of the \#MeToo movement.
STUDY DESIGN: Over an 11-month period, all gynaecological first-time visitors to our outpatient clinic were asked two dichotomous questions that screened for domestic violence and examined whether the violence had an ongoing impact on the respondent's everyday life. We used logistic regression models to assess whether the launch of \#MeToo was associated with the answers to these two questions.
RESULTS: Of the 6,957 screened women, 154 (2.2 \%) tested positive for domestic violence. Among the screen-positive women, 87 (56.5 \%) reported that the violence affected their health and well-being. Of these 87 women, 52.9 \% wanted further support and 72.4 \% had already contacted psychiatric care. Out of all of the patients, the proportion of screen-positive respondents was 2.3 \% before and 2.2 \% after \#MeToo. We did not detect increased odds of self-reporting domestic violence (odds ratio 0.97, 95 \% confidence interval 0.70-1.36) or its ongoing impact on the victim's everyday life (odds ratio 1.05, 95 \% confidence interval 0.53-2.07) after \#MeToo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our two-question screening tool detected a lower prevalence of domestic violence among gynaecological outpatients than previous reports examining the general population. Our results illustrate the dire challenges in screening for domestic violence that persist even in the post-\#MeToo era. Domestic violence remains a highly intimate, stigmatising, and underreported health issue, and systematic measures to screen for and prevent it should be advocated, both in gynaecological patients and the general population.},

Reported rates of the genotype-specific genital concordance of HPV infection among heterosexual partners vary. Most studies have evaluated only male/female genital transmission, but lately, the oral region has gained interest because of a rising trend of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Risk factors for type-specific concordance have been reported as an increasing number of younger couples, persistent HPV infection, higher frequency of sexual intercourse, rising number of spouse's lifetime sexual partners, and sexual relations with prostitutes. However, the concordance of the same genital HPV genotype does not absolutely mean that it has been transmitted by the current partner. There are also other possible non-sexual transmission routes. The detected HPV infection may also be a reactivation of a previous infection. The high complexity of HPV transmission dynamics within an individual him-/herself as well as within sexual couples is discussed in this article.},

As part of the prospective Finnish Family HPV Study, we analysed the physical state and viral copy numbers of HPV16 in asymptomatic oral infections that either persisted or cleared during the 6-year follow-up. The persister group comprised 14 women and 7 men with 51 and 21 HPV16-positive brush samples. The clearance group included 41 women and 13 men, with 64 and 24 samples, respectively. Physical state and viral DNA load were assessed by using quantitative PCR for HPV16 E2 and E6 genes. E2/E6 ratio was calculated and HPV16 was classified as episomal, mixed or integrated with values of 0.93-1.08, {\textless}0.93 and 0, respectively. In both genders, the physical state of HPV16 was significantly different between the cases and controls (P{\textless}0.001). HPV16 was episomal in all men and 66 \% (27/41) of women who cleared their infection. HPV16 was mixed and/or integrated in71 \% and 57 \%of the women and men persisters, respectively. The mean HPV16 copy number per 50 ng genomic DNA was nearly 5.5-fold higher in the women than in the men clearance group (P=0.011). Only in men, HPV16 copy numbers were higher in persisters than in the clearance group (P=0.039). To conclude, in both genders, persistent oral HPV16 infections were associated with the mixed or integrated form of HPV16, while in the clearance groups, episomal HPV16 predominated. This indicates that HPV16 integration is a common event even in asymptomatic oral infections, which might predispose the infected subjects to progressive disease.},

Our purpose was to study the prevalence of mixed flora (MF), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast infection in women with known HPV outcomes during the 72-month follow-up (FU). Asymptomatic pregnant women (N = 329) were enrolled in the third trimester of their pregnancy. Pap smears and HPV genotyping samples were taken at baseline and at 12-, 24-, 36- and 72-month FU visits, with one additional sample at 2 months for HPV. HPV testing was done with nested PCR and Multimetrix assay to determine the point prevalence and persistence of HPV. Conventional Pap smears were scored for MF, BV and yeast infection. Covariates of the outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and Poisson regression. Of the women, 76.6\% (252/329) tested HPV-positive at least once during the FU. BV was detected in 12.2\% (40/329), MF in 57.4\% (189/329) and yeast infection in 22.9\% (73/329) of the women. HPV-positive women had significantly more leucocytes in their Pap smear (p = 0.023) than the HPV-negative ones. MF (OR 2.75, 95\% CI 1.77-4.27) and yeast infection (p = 0.007) were linked with HPV positivity. BV but not yeast infection was a significant covariate of HPV persistence (p = 0.024; OR 2.15, 95\% CI 1.13-4.08). MF and yeast infection were associated with prevalent cervical HPV infection. In the longitudinal setting, BV predicted HPV persistence, implicating that treatment of asymptomatic BV in women with cervical HR-HPV infections might be justified.},

Genotype-specific concordance of HPV infections (oral/genital) and their co-variates among 131 marital couples were determined during 6-year follow-up (FU). Seven oral scrapings were taken from both spouses, accompanied by six genital samplings from the women and one (at baseline) from the male partners. HPV-genotyping was performed by nested PCR and a Luminex®-based Multimetrix Assay. Demographic data were collected with questionnaires at baseline and study conclusion. Prevalence of oral HPV varied from 10.3 to 27.0 \% and 15.8 to 31.3 \% in women and men, respectively. At baseline, 37.6 \% of the male genital samples were HPV-positive while in female genital samples, HPV prevalence varied from 13.3 to 59.4 \%. Only 15 couples had HPV genotype-specific concordance (oral-oral n = 7; male oral-female genital n = 9; female oral-male genital n = 2). In the nested case-control setting, higher number of deliveries (OR 0.145, 95\%CI 0.030-0.706, p = 0.017) and higher number of intercourse (OR 0.488, 95\%CI 0.243-0.978, p = 0.043) decreased the likelihood of concordant HPV infections while practicing oral sex increased the risk (OR 0.299, 95\%CI 0.120-0.748, p = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, the likelihood of concordance was decreased by higher number of pregnancies of the female partner (p = 0.020) and by higher frequency of intercourse reported by the male spouse (p = 0.027). To conclude, asymptomatic HPV infections were common in both spouses while genotype-specific concordance was low. This supports the view that HPV profile of the spouses has been established before the current marital relationship.},

In univariate analysis, LR-HPV seropositivity was related to smoking status, history of genital warts and being seropositive to HR-HPV. Oral HR-HPV DNA and baseline LR-HPV seropositivity predicted HR-HPV seropositivity. Seroconversion to HPV6, 11, 16, 18 and 45 antigens during follow-up was found in 24.6, 11.5, 5.7, 5.7 and 0.8 \%, respectively. Seroconversion to LR-HPV was negatively related to a higher number of children and oral sex, and positively associated with seroconversion to HR-HPV. In multivariate analysis, the same predictors remained significant except for the number of children. In univariate generalised estimating equations (GEE) for HR-HPV, being seroconverted to LR-HPV was the only predictor, but lost its significance in multivariate analyses. Decay of all HPV L1 antibodies was rare and observed in 0-2 \%. The HPV antibody profile in men was dominated by response to HPV6, also showing the highest cumulative seroconversion. Oral HPV infection might affect HPV serology: (1) HPV DNA in oral mucosa is associated with baseline HR-HPV seropositivity and (2) practising oral sex significantly reduces longitudinal seroconversion to HPV6 and/or 11.},

Knowledge of oral HPV infection among males is needed to elucidate the transmission routes and potential for prevention.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, genotype distribution, and incidence of oral HPV infections among healthy Finnish men followed for 7 yr.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Oral scrapings for HPV testing were taken from 131 fathers-to-be (mean age: 28.9 yr) at baseline and at 2-mo, 6-mo, 12-mo, 24-mo, 36-mo, and 7-yr follow-up visits to detect prevalent and incident HPV infections. Purified DNA extracted from scrapings was used for HPV genotyping, with the Multimetrix kit (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) detecting 24 genotypes.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Point prevalence, genotype distribution, and incident rates of oral HPV infections. Demographic data were collected using structured questionnaires, and covariates of incident oral HPV infections were analysed using uni- and multivariate Poisson regression (for panel data).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The point prevalence of oral HPV infection fluctuated from 15.1\% to 31.1\% during the follow-up period. In total, 17 different HPV genotypes were found. At baseline, the single most frequent genotype among the HPV-positive samples was HPV16 (33.3\%; 8 of 24), followed by HPV33 (12.5\%) and HPV82 (12.5\%). Multiple-type infections comprised 16.7\% (4 of 24), HPV16 being involved in all combinations. For baseline-negative men, the mean time to the first incident infection ranged from 3.9 mo (HPV82) to 25.7 mo (HPV56). None of the demographic factors was a significant independent predictor of incident oral HPV infections in multivariate models.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of oral HPV DNA carriage in men is common, HPV16 being the most prevalent genotype. Oral mucosa may play a significant role in HPV transmission.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Genotype-specific concordance among human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected spouses is incompletely assessed. HPV concordance is of importance in counselling HPV-infected subjects and their partners.
AIM: To determine HPV-genotype distribution and prevalence in semen and urethral samples of young fathers and their concordance with HPV-genotypes in cervical and oral mucosal samples of their spouses.
METHODS: In the Finnish Family HPV study, urethral and semen samples were collected from 131 fathers-to-be for HPV genotyping with Multimetrix assay. HPV-genotyping data were correlated with the data of the cervical and oral mucosal samples of the spouses collected at third trimester pregnancy at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Concordance of HPV-genotypes between the spouses.
RESULTS: Urethral and/or semen samples tested HPV positive in 47/131 (35.9\%) of the fathers-to-be, more frequently in semen (28/90; 31\%) than in urethral (29/128; 23\%) samples. In women, 18.8\% of their cervical and 17.2\% of the oral samples tested HPV-positive. Of the HPV-positive samples, HPV16 was the most frequent genotype, present in 39.3\% of semen, 77.3\% of mothers' oral, and 29.2\% of cervical samples. Multiple-type infections were found in 24.1\% of HPV-positive urethral and 21.6\% of semen samples. In mothers, half of their cervical and 4.5\% of oral HPV were multiple-type infections. The HPV-genotype-specific concordance among spouses ranged from 0\% to 9.5\%, according to the sampling sites. Altogether, eight couples disclosing such a concordance were analyzed separately for a risk-profile. Mothers of the HPV-concordant couples reported significantly higher number ({\textgreater}6) of life-time sexual partners than did the discordant mothers (P=0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic HPV infections were common in both parents, while the genotype-specific concordance among spouses was low. In both partners, HPV16 is the dominant genotype. HPV6 was a prevalent HPV genotype in male genitalia. Female risk profile might enhance the transmission of HPV infection to her male partner and increase the genotype-specific HPV concordance between the spouses.},
