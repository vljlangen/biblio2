abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Many chronic diseases and their medications may induce sexual
  problems. This study aimed to evaluate whether general practitioners (GPs) raise
  sexual health issues during appointments with patients who have chronic diseases.
  STUDY DESIGN: A web-based questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 1,000
  GPs in Finland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study aim was to determine GPs' self-reported
  inquiry into sexual problems with patients who have chronic diseases and GPs' awareness
  of medications inducing sexual problems. RESULTS: Only 16.2% of the GPs inquired
  about sexual health issues, typically during appointments dealing with reproductive
  organs. A majority (66.9%) considered sexual problems to be side-effects of medications,
  but only 17.9% followed up about them. Compared to male GPs, female GPs were more
  likely to inquire about gynecologic patients' sexual issues (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05-2.99),
  but less likely to ask about them with urologic (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.91) and
  neurologic patients (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.72). The GPs aged 40-49 and 50-65 were
  more likely than those aged 27-39 to inquire about sexual health issues among patients
  with cardiovascular (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.11-7.44, OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.16-7.19) and neurologic
  (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.45-14.82, OR 5.68, 95% CI 1.87-17.23) diseases. CONCLUSIONS:
  GPs seldom inquire about sexual problems with patients who have chronic diseases
  or after prescribing medications for these conditions, which may lead to underdiagnosis
  and undertreatment of sexual problems."
