abstract: "Objective Although sexual problems are common, they are rarely brought
  up in appointments with general practitioners (GPs). We aimed to assess the barriers
  that hinder GPs from bringing up sexual health issues and to evaluate the need for
  education on sexual medicine. Design A web-based questionnaire was used. Setting
  Four fields were included: A) the self-reported competence in discussing sexual
  health and treating patients with these issues, B) the barriers to bringing up patients'
  sexual health problems, C) the source of education on sexual medicine and D) the
  need for education on sexual medicine. Subjects A random sample of 1000 GPs in Finland
  (a response rate of 43.5%, n = 402). Main outcome measures GPs' self-assessed competence
  in discussing and treating sexual health issues, related barriers to bringing up
  the topic and the reported need for education. Results The main reasons reported
  for not bringing up sexual health issues were shortness of the appointment time
  (85.6%), a lack of knowledge (83.6%) and a lack of experience with sexual medicine
  (81.8%). The male GPs reported better competence in discussing the issues and treating
  male patients, whereas the female GPs reported better competence in discussing the
  issues with female patients. No differences emerged between genders regarding treating
  female patients. Nearly 90% of the GPs expressed needing more education about sexual
  medicine. Conclusions Although the GPs reported good competence in discussing sexual
  health issues with their patients, several barriers to bringing up sexual health
  issues emerged. Continuing education was desired and could lessen these barriers.Key
  pointsOnly a few studies have evaluated the competence of general practitioners
  (GPs) in addressing sexual health issues with their patients.In our study, the GPs
  reported a high competence in discussing patients' sexual health issues regardless
  of the patient's gender.However, several barriers to bringing up sexual health issues
  in appointments emerged.A majority of the GPs expressed a need for continuing education
  about sexual medicine."
