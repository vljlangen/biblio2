abstract: The aim was to evaluate the herpes simplex virus (HSV) seroprevalence and
  seroconversion among 285 pregnant women and their 120 male spouses in Finland during
  a six-year follow-up (FU) between 1998-2008. We also studied the effect of sexual
  habits, pregnancy, and other demographic factors on the acquisition of HSV infection.
  Combined HSV-1 and HSV-2-IgG antibodies were assessed in the first baseline serum
  samples with an indirect enzyme immunoassay method. The individuals with seronegative
  or borderline HSV serology at baseline were additionally tested using their latest
  FU serum sample available. The overall HSV seroprevalence during the FU was 58.9%
  (168/285) among the women and 53.3% (64/120) among their spouses. The seroconversion
  rate was 11.4% (15/132) and 12.5% (8/64) among women and their spouses, respectively.
  Both spouses were HSV seropositive in 39.2% (47/120). To determine the HSV-2 seroprevalence,
  we also tested all HSV-seropositive participants using HSV-2-specific antigen. HSV-2
  seropositivity was detected in 10.9% (44/405) of the participants. The age (p =
  0.006) and history of genital warts (p = 0.006) of the women were associated with
  combined HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 seropositivity, while a younger age was related to HSV
  seroconversion (p = 0.023). Among the male spouses, HSV seropositivity was associated
  with the practice of oral sex (p = 0.033). To conclude, women of childbearing age
  acquire primary HSV infections and the presence of HSV in oral epithelium is common
  among HSV-seropositive individuals.
