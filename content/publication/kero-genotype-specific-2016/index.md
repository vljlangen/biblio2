abstract: Data on genotype-specific concordance of oral-oral and genital-oral HPV
  infections among marital couples are key to understand HPV transmission between
  spouses. Genotype-specific concordance of HPV infections (oral/genital) and their
  co-variates among 131 marital couples were determined during 6-year follow-up (FU).
  Seven oral scrapings were taken from both spouses, accompanied by six genital samplings
  from the women and one (at baseline) from the male partners. HPV-genotyping was
  performed by nested PCR and a Luminex®-based Multimetrix Assay. Demographic data
  were collected with questionnaires at baseline and study conclusion. Prevalence
  of oral HPV varied from 10.3 to 27.0 % and 15.8 to 31.3 % in women and men, respectively.
  At baseline, 37.6 % of the male genital samples were HPV-positive while in female
  genital samples, HPV prevalence varied from 13.3 to 59.4 %. Only 15 couples had
  HPV genotype-specific concordance (oral-oral n = 7; male oral-female genital n = 9;
  female oral-male genital n = 2). In the nested case-control setting, higher number
  of deliveries (OR 0.145, 95%CI 0.030-0.706, p = 0.017) and higher number of intercourse
  (OR 0.488, 95%CI 0.243-0.978, p = 0.043) decreased the likelihood of concordant
  HPV infections while practicing oral sex increased the risk (OR 0.299, 95%CI 0.120-0.748,
  p = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, the likelihood of concordance was decreased
  by higher number of pregnancies of the female partner (p = 0.020) and by higher
  frequency of intercourse reported by the male spouse (p = 0.027). To conclude, asymptomatic
  HPV infections were common in both spouses while genotype-specific concordance was
  low. This supports the view that HPV profile of the spouses has been established
  before the current marital relationship.
