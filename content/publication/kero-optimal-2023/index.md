abstract: Next-generation sequencing-based microbiological analysis is a complex way
  to profile vaginal microbiome samples since each step affects the results gained.
  Methodologies for sample collection lack golden standards. We compared Puritan DNA/RNA
  swab (PS) and Copan FLOQ swab (CS) and provided consistent and reliable microbiome
  profiles analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected two consecutive vaginal
  samples utilizing PS with room temperature storing and CS with instant freezing
  from 26 women. Variable region 4 of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with single
  PCR by custom-designed dual-indexed primers and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq system.
  Read quality control, operational taxonomic unit tables, and alpha and beta diversities
  analysis were performed, and community richness, diversity, and evenness were evaluated
  and compared between the two samplings and tests. Nineteen sample pairs produced
  detectable, intact DNA during the extraction protocol and/or further microbial profiles.
  Alpha bacterial diversity indices were independent on the collection protocol. No
  significant statistical differences were found in the measured beta diversity metrics
  between the collection methods. Of the women, 43% had Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal
  microbiome profile despite of collection method. Previously reported important vaginal
  microbiome phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria
  were present in the sample set although their relative abundances varied among individuals.
  PS and CS enable constant vaginal microbiota sampling. The PS method with no need
  for instant freezing is suitable for on-site collections at clinics. Furthermore,
  it seems to be possible to take two samples instead of one with constant microbiological
  results.
