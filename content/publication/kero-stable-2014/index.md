abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are associated with sexual behavior.
  Changes in the sexual habits of couples and their impact on male genital and oral
  HPV infections were determined during 7 years of follow-up (FU). At baseline and
  7 years FU, urethral, semen/penile, and oral samples were collected from 46 men
  and cervical and oral samples of their spouses for HPV DNA detection. Demographic
  data and risk factors of spouses were recorded by questionnaire at both time points
  and analyzed for concordance. HPV genotyping was done with the Multimetrix® kit.
  At baseline, 29.5 % of the male genital and 11 % of their oral samples tested positive.
  Incident genital HPV infection was found in 23 % and oral infection in 10.9 % of
  men. Genotype-specific persistence was detected in one man (HPV53) in genital samples.
  Moderate to almost perfect concordance of changes in sexual habits during FU among
  spouses were found. Changing partners [p = 0.028; odds ratio (OR) = 15; 95 % confidence
  interval (CI) 1.355-166.054] and marital status (p = 0.001; 95 % CI 0.000-0.002)
  increased the risk of incident genital HPV infections. The overall outcome of genital
  HPV disease in men was linked to the frequency of sexual intercourse (p = 0.023;
  95 % CI 0.019-0.026) and changes in marital status (p = 0.022; 95 % CI 0.019-0.026),
  while oral HPV infections were associated with the number of sexual partners (p = 0.047;
  95 % CI 0.041-0.052). Taken together, asymptomatic genital HPV infections among
  the men were common. The risk of incident genital HPV infections increased among
  men reporting a change of sexual partner during FU, implicating that a stable marital
  relationship protects against oral and genital HPV infection.
