abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in
  the head and neck region is poorly understood, and their impact on collective HPV-specific
  immunity is not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we have performed a
  systematic analysis of HPV16-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in 21 women with
  known oral and genital HPV DNA status and HPV serology (Ab) based on 6-year follow-up
  data. These women being a subgroup from the Finnish Family HPV Study were recalled
  for blood sampling to be tested for their CMI-responses to HPV16 E2, E6, and E7
  peptides. RESULTS: The results showed that HPV16 E2-specific lymphocyte proliferation
  was more prevalent in women who tested HPV16 DNA negative in oral mucosa and were
  either HPV16 seropositive or negative than in HPV16 DNA+/Ab+ women (p = 0.046 and
  p = 0.035). In addition, the HPV16 DNA-/Ab- women most often displayed E6-specific
  proliferation (p = 0.020). Proportional cytokine profiles indicated that oral HPV16-negative
  women were characterized by prominent IFN-γ and IL-5 secretion not found in women
  with persisting oral HPV16 (p = 0.014 and p = 0.040, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results indicate that the naturally arising immune response induced by oral
  HPV infections displays a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile while women with persisting
  oral HPV16 might have an impaired HPV16-specific CMI, shifted partly toward a Th2
  profile, similarly as seen earlier among patients with high-grade genital HPV lesions.
  Thus, the lack of HPV 16 E2 and E6 specific T memory cells and Th2 cytokines might
  also predispose women for persistent oral HPV16 infection which might be related
  to the risk of cancer.'
