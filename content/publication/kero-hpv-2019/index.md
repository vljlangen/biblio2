abstract: Sexual intercourse is regarded as the primary route of human papillomavirus
  (HPV) transmission. Reported rates of the genotype-specific genital concordance
  of HPV infection among heterosexual partners vary. Most studies have evaluated only
  male/female genital transmission, but lately, the oral region has gained interest
  because of a rising trend of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Risk factors for
  type-specific concordance have been reported as an increasing number of younger
  couples, persistent HPV infection, higher frequency of sexual intercourse, rising
  number of spouse's lifetime sexual partners, and sexual relations with prostitutes.
  However, the concordance of the same genital HPV genotype does not absolutely mean
  that it has been transmitted by the current partner. There are also other possible
  non-sexual transmission routes. The detected HPV infection may also be a reactivation
  of a previous infection. The high complexity of HPV transmission dynamics within
  an individual him-/herself as well as within sexual couples is discussed in this
  article.
