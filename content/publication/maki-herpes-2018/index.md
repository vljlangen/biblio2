abstract: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in neurons and recurrent
  infections in oral mucosa. This prospective study analyzes HSV prevalence in oral
  mucosal brush samples from men with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status. We
  hypothesized that HSV-1-infection could facilitate HPV persistence as a cofactor.
  This study was a part of the Finnish Family HPV study accomplished at the University
  of Turku/Turku University Hospital, Finland. A total of 139 men (mean age 28.6 ± 4.9
  years) were enrolled at 36+-weeks of their partner's pregnancy and thereafter followed-up
  for 6 years. Altogether, 722 samples, extracted from oral brush samples collected
  at the enrollment timepoint (baseline) and at 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-month, and 6
  years, were available. HSV DNA was analyzed with quantitative PCR. HSV-1 results
  were compared with the known HPV data. The prevalence of oral HSV-1 shedding varied
  between 0-7.2% (mean 2.8%) among the men. Mean copy numbers varied between 4 and
  550 genome copies/sample. A total of 18 (12.9%) men were found HSV-1-positive at
  least once, two of them twice. Neither smoking nor oral sex was associated with
  the oral HSV-1-DNA finding. HPV/HSV-1 co-infection was found in 6 (4.3%) men, all
  of them having persistent HPV-infection. In conclusion, HSV-1 and its coinfection
  with HPV in oral mucosa was rare.
