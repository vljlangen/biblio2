abstract: The aim was to determine the rate of dissociative disorders among psychiatric
  in- (n = 34) and out-patients (n = 37) and to compare the rate to that of nonclinical
  subjects (n = 297). Dissociative disorders (17% of patients) could be grouped according
  to the severity of the symptoms and their relation to affective disorders.
